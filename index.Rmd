## About

Born and raised in [Chittagong Hill Tracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong_Hill_Tracts), I have been living here in Portugal since 2014. I have an undergraduate degree in economics from [Monash university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University) and a master degree in statistics from [University of Évora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_%C3%89vora).

Currently I am working as research fellow at University of Évora. I also teach part-time at [Católica Lisbon School of Business & Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%C3%B3lica_Lisbon_School_of_Business_%26_Economics).

In my spare time, I enjoy playing the guitar. I also enjoy spending time in [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) and [Statalist](https://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general).

Fun Fact: My last name -- [Chakma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakma_people) -- happens to be the name of the indigenous  community that I belong to.
